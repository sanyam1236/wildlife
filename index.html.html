  <p><h2>The act of protecting the species of wild plants and animals from becoming extinct is termed as wildlife conservation. The same is achieved through the execution of different plans and policies by the human being.<br>      The wildlife is an important factor of our ecosystem, without their existence, the ecological balance will turn to an imbalanced state. As each and every creature has its right to exist and therefore they must be provided with a proper habitat and conditions.
But the conditions prevailing are totally different. Man has become so much selfish in his desires that he forgot that other organisms have the same right.
 World Animal Protection is working to transform the lives of animals, permanently. How?

By challenging the root causes of their suffering so we can make the biggest, lasting impact on their lives. We achieve this by working towards:

Ending the commercial exploitation of wildlife
Moving the tourism industry away from heartless wildlife entertainment
Ending the exploitation of wild animals and their use in traditional Asian medicine
Delivering innovative solutions for wild animals
Producing and distributing animals in the wild and animals in farming reports
Ensuring wild animals and their habitats are legally protected
Delivering campaigns to safeguard wild animals
Transforming the global food system for the protection of farm animals
We are on a mission to give wildlife their right to a wild life.
